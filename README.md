# Protein Sequence Classification Project

## Project Description
This project focuses on building a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to classify protein sequences. The model captures patterns in protein sequences to classify them into functional categories, aiding in understanding protein functions and interactions. This is crucial for advancing research in biotechnology and life sciences.
